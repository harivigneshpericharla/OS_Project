🧠 Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer

A web-based interactive tool to simulate and visualize how Operating Systems manage memory internally. This project helps students clearly understand complex concepts like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory through real-time animations and simulations.

🚀 Project Overview

The Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) that demonstrates core OS memory management techniques.

It allows users to:

Simulate memory allocation
Visualize address translation
Observe page faults and replacements
Understand fragmentation and allocation strategies
🧩 Features
📌 Paging & Virtual Memory Simulator
Logical → Physical address mapping
Page Table visualization
Page fault detection
FIFO & LRU page replacement algorithms
Hit/Miss tracking with fault rate
📌 Segmentation & Dynamic Allocation Simulator
Segment Table (Base + Limit)
Memory allocation strategies:
First Fit
Best Fit
Worst Fit
Internal & External Fragmentation
Free space management & hole merging
⚙️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6+)
Visualization: Canvas API
Icons & UI: Lucide Icons, Google Fonts
Version Control: GitHub
